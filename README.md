# CookingApp
Android recipes app with API.AI

Android Studio + Firebase (https://console.firebase.google.com/)

If you have an abundance of ingredients in your kitchen and you have no idea of how and what to cook then this app is definitely your choice

Functionalities:
1. Main screen shows the list of dishes, search, view detail
2. A chatbot is used for creating dishes based on what input ingredients are. For instance, if I type "tomato" and "beef", this bot will provide user with some dishes made by these two ingredients (such as Beef soup with tomato).
3. A chat bot can listen to user voice and also produce results (same as above) but the bot will speak back to you when you speak.

*Note: I made this app based on Vietnamese mainly. If you like this idea and use your own language then you should customise your own bot at Dialogflow https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/
